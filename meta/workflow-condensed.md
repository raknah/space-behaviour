# Theoretical Modeling Workflow: Space Radiation Effects on Biological Systems

*A minimal but complete end-to-end framework from particle physics to cognitive phenotype*

This document outlines a condensed 12-month research blueprint that preserves the original vision: to demonstrate how first-principles physics (e.g. space radiation) can causally propagate through molecular, cellular, and neural levels to influence behaviour.

Instead of building 10 separate modules, we restructure them into three main stages:

Tier-0: Radiation → DNA Damage (Milestones 1-2)

Tier-1: Molecular Response (Milestones 3-4)

Behaviour Bridge: Cell damage → Circuit rewiring → n-back performance (Composite of Milestones 5-10)

This is achievable in ~10 hours/week for 12 months and provides 3 publishable assets by the end of the year.

## Foundation Phase: Radiation-Matter Interaction Framework

### Milestone 1: Stochastic Radiation Field Characterization
- Construct a probabilistic model of the space radiation environment using NASA's OLTARIS/CREME96 data  
- Build energy deposition kernels that capture LET (Linear Energy Transfer) distributions  
- Create a Monte Carlo framework for particle tracks through tissue-equivalent materials  

**Output**: Spatiotemporal radiation dose maps with uncertainty quantification

### Milestone 2: Molecular Damage Landscape
- Develop a mechanistic model linking radiation tracks to DNA damage patterns (SSBs, DSBs, clustered lesions)  
- Implement reaction-diffusion equations for radical species generation and propagation  
- Map damage probability distributions to genomic coordinates using publicly available chromatin accessibility data  

**Output**: Probabilistic damage maps as tensor fields over genomic space

## Molecular Response Phase: Gene Regulatory Dynamics

### Milestone 3: p53 Network Mechanistic Model
- Build a stochastic differential equation system for the p53-MDM2-ATM network  
- Incorporate radiation-induced post-translational modifications as state-dependent rate modulations  
- Use parameter distributions from literature meta-analysis (not point estimates)  

**Output**: Ensemble of trajectory solutions capturing population heterogeneity

### Milestone 4: Extended GRN Architecture
- Expand to include DNA repair pathways (HR, NHEJ, BER) as coupled subsystems  
- Model competitive resource allocation between repair, apoptosis, and senescence  
- Implement Boolean network abstraction for pathway crosstalk validation  

**Output**: Multi-scale GRN model with validated logic gates

## Behaviour Bridge Phase: Molecular Damage to Cognitive Output

> *This phase replaces Milestones 5–10 with a lean, composite module that preserves the theoretical chain from molecular insult to behaviour.*

### Milestone 5′: Synaptic Pruning from Damage Scores
- Translate per-cell damage into synapse pruning probabilities  
- Use logistic model: `p_synapse_loss = σ(α·damage + β)`  
- Generate binary synapse loss mask across simulated circuit  

**Output**: Edge deletion probability matrix for neural graph

### Milestone 6′: Network Rewiring and Graph Metrics
- Represent brain region as a Watts–Strogatz or small-world graph  
- Remove/rewire edges using generated mask  
- Calculate efficiency, clustering, and path metrics  

**Output**: Graph-theoretic degradation signature

### Milestone 7′: Cognitive Readout via Reservoir Computing
- Build a minimal reservoir network to simulate 2-back working memory  
- Feed rewired graphs to reservoir layer  
- Quantify drop in accuracy as a function of upstream damage  

**Output**: Dose-dependent behavioural degradation curve with uncertainty bounds

## Integration Phase: Multi-Scale Validation Framework

### Milestone 11: Hierarchical Model Coupling
- Implement scale-bridging operators connecting each modeling level  
- Use approximate Bayesian computation to propagate uncertainty across scales  
- Validate against NASA twin study and bed rest analog data  

**Output**: Fully integrated multi-scale model with uncertainty quantification

### Milestone 12: Predictive Scenario Engine
- Create counterfactual simulation framework for different mission profiles  
- Implement sensitivity analysis to identify critical intervention points  
- Build dose-response surfaces for key behavioral/cognitive endpoints  

**Output**: Interactive tool for mission planning with confidence bounds

# Julia Implementation Strategy
Each milestone leverages Julia's strengths:

- DifferentialEquations.jl for stochastic dynamics  
- Agents.jl for cellular populations  
- Graphs.jl for network analysis  
- Flux.jl for neural state mappings  
- Turing.jl for Bayesian uncertainty propagation  
- Makie.jl for interactive visualization  

# Data Requirements (All Freely Available)

- NASA Space Radiation Data (OLTARIS)  
- ENCODE chromatin accessibility  
- STRING protein interaction database  
- Allen Brain Atlas  
- Human Connectome Project  
- NASA Life Sciences Data Archive  

This workflow builds understanding from first principles while maintaining empirical grounding at each scale, ensuring theoretical predictions cannot be dismissed regardless of what effects emerge.
