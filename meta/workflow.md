# Theoretical Modeling Workflow: Space Radiation Effects on Biological Systems

*A minimal but complete end-to-end framework from particle physics to cognitive phenotype*

This document outlines a condensed 12-month research blueprint that preserves the original vision: to demonstrate how first-principles physics (e.g. space radiation) can causally propagate through molecular, cellular, and neural levels to influence behaviour.

## Foundation Phase: Radiation-Matter Interaction Framework

### Milestone 1: Stochastic Radiation Field Characterization

- Construct a probabilistic model of the space radiation environment using NASA's OLTARIS/CREME96 data
- Build energy deposition kernels that capture LET (Linear Energy Transfer) distributions

Output: Spatiotemporal radiation dose maps with uncertainty quantification

### Milestone 2: Molecular Damage Landscape

- Develop a mechanistic model linking radiation tracks to DNA damage patterns (SSBs, DSBs, clustered lesions)
- Implement reaction-diffusion equations for radical species generation and propagation
- Map damage probability distributions to genomic coordinates using publicly available chromatin accessibility data

**Output**: Probabilistic damage maps as tensor fields over genomic space

**Output**: Brain-wide vulnerability heat maps with temporal evolution

### Milestone 8: Network Topology Degradation

- Build graph-theoretic model of neural circuit connectivity
- Implement edge removal/weight modification based on cellular damage states
- Calculate information flow metrics and small-world properties over time

**Output**: Quantified degradation of network efficiency metrics

## Behavioral Emergence Phase: Cognitive and Behavioral Manifestations

### Milestone 9: Cognitive Function Mapping

- Link network degradation patterns to specific cognitive domains using connectome data
- Implement reservoir computing model to simulate working memory under damage
- Model decision-making using drift-diffusion framework with radiation-modified parameters

**Output**: Predicted cognitive performance trajectories with confidence intervals

### Milestone 10: Behavioral State Space Analysis

- Construct low-dimensional behavioral manifold from high-dimensional neural states
- Model stress-response coupling between radiation exposure and HPA axis dynamics
- Implement dynamical systems analysis of mood/alertness cycles

**Output**: Phase portraits of behavioral states under chronic exposure

## Integration Phase: Multi-Scale Validation Framework

### Milestone 11: Hierarchical Model Coupling

- Implement scale-bridging operators connecting each modeling level
- Use approximate Bayesian computation to propagate uncertainty across scales
- Validate against NASA twin study and bed rest analog data

**Output**: Fully integrated multi-scale model with uncertainty quantification

### Milestone 12: Predictive Scenario Engine

- Create counterfactual simulation framework for different mission profiles
- Implement sensitivity analysis to identify critical intervention points
- Build dose-response surfaces for key behavioral/cognitive endpoints

**Output**: Interactive tool for mission planning with confidence bounds
